==============

Code that helps automate the testing and optimization for Spimbot cs233 uiuc
This code was made to allow Automated testing for the 2012 spimbot assignment.
It allow one to test you code hundreds of times with random and preset seeds to 
verify your optimization's. If you have heatmap.py it can also map the random coin distribution
This code has been tested on python 2.6.6 and 2.7.1 but should work on python 2.5.2 and up on
any Linux or mac. 
It assumes that your spimbot is called spimbot.h and your second is spimbot2.h
It also requires a symlink to QtSpimbot in the same folder.
